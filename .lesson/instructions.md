## About
This application is used by a restaurant to calculate the price of the orders of its clients. You have to choose between some options, menus, type etc, that you provide and you call the app and then it calculates the total price and displays it in the console along other information.

It works (mostly) and has lots of comments which is good, right ?

But someone tell me that there is no tests and no obvious way to prove that the app is working as expected, could you help us ?


## What's my job ?

You need to make this code more robust and bring some quality in. 
This means that you need to bring structure to this actual code, create tests, seperate domain logic and models from infrastructure code

Independently of the language and it's technical constraints, code needs strucure that express clearly with is your business domain and functionalities and what is beyond the boundaries of your system (infrastructure, inputs, outputs, UI, services, db etc...) 

## Tips

- Have a look at [Lesson Help](.lesson/help.md) file to see some tips about csharp and this exercise
- use [test.sh](./test.sh) to run the actual tests with a very simple golden master
- run a working sample of the app with [runsample.sh](./runsample.sh)
